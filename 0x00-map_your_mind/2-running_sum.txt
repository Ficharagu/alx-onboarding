To develop an algorithm

Calculate a running sum

A user will enter numbers that will be added to the sum and when a negative number is encountered, stop adding numbers and write out the final result

FOR infinite
    number INPUT "Enter number"

    IF number is negative THEN
        end loop
    ELSE
        add number to running_sum
    ENDIF
ENDFOR

OUTPUT running_sum
